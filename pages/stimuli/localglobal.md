title: Local versus global processing

Once you press **Start**, try your best to find a **triangle**! The whole shape can be a triangle but also the small elements forming the whole shape can be triangles.
                        Please press right arrow <button class="btn btn-secondary">&rarr;</button>, if a triangle is present and  left arrow <button class="btn btn-secondary">&larr;</button>  if it is absent.
                        Try to be as fast and as accurate as you can!

#### What just happened?
 If you look at your responses, you can see that you reacted faster (and also more accurately) when the whole shape was a triangle than if the small elements forming the big shape were triangles. In other words, you see the **forest** rather than **trees**.

Many researchers could show the exactly same phenomena and concluded, that we probably have a preference of processing the whole shape instead of processing the small elements, i.e. we direct our attention first on the whole shape.
It seems to be difficult for us to overcome our dominant strategy of attending the whole shape.
Therefore, we are typically slower and make more mistakes when we have to find the triangle within the small elements forming the whole shape.
Interestingly, baboons are much better at finding a local shape and chimpanzees are equally good at both tasks.
